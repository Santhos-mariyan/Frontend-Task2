🎉 Thrilled to announce the launch of my new web project WebProject! 🎉

This project is a simple yet functional website built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, featuring:
✨ A modern Contact Page with form validation and instant feedback.
📝 An interactive To-Do List App where users can add and delete tasks easily.
🎨 Clean and responsive UI styled with CSS, including gradients, shadows, and hover effects.
⚡ Real-time DOM manipulation with JavaScript for better interactivity.

Building this project helped me strengthen my skills in frontend development, UI/UX design, and JavaScript event handling. Excited to keep enhancing it with more features! 🚀
